# SSHDeck Architecture

Read this to get oriented before touching the code. For features and getting started as a user, see [../README.md](../README.md);
for when/how to split a file into a new module, see [MODULARITY.md](MODULARITY.md).

## 1. Overview

The core object is a **host-centric, two-level structure**:

- **Level 1 = Host**: an SSH server, storing connection parameters (host, port, user, key).
- **Level 2 = Forward**: a port forward nested under a host, storing only the forwarding parameters (mode, bind, target).

The host is a UI/data "object"; there is no reusable, persistent primary SSH connection (Windows' bundled OpenSSH doesn't
support ControlMaster multiplexing). What actually persists is each forward's own `ssh.exe` child process. "Send command",
"Open terminal", and "Upload key" each make a one-off `ssh` call as needed, reusing the host's connection parameters.

## 2. Tech Stack

- Desktop app shell and native backend: Tauri 2 + Rust
- Frontend UI: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS, local shadcn/ui-style components
- Forward execution: Rust calls the system `ssh`; the external terminal opens a PowerShell console running interactive `ssh`
- Target platform: **Windows only**. Packaging produces an NSIS installer with a Simplified Chinese / English selector and a changeable install directory, built by `.github/workflows/build.yml`.
  The backend calls Windows tooling directly (`powershell`, `netstat`/`tasklist`, `Add-WindowsCapability`, the registry)

## 3. Getting Started

Requires Node.js, npm, the Rust stable toolchain, and the Windows OpenSSH Client. If PowerShell doesn't recognize `cargo`/`rustc`,
add `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` to PATH.

```powershell
npm.cmd --prefix frontend install   # install deps (from project root)
npm.cmd run tauri:dev               # run the dev build
cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri\Cargo.toml   # rust check
npm.cmd run build                   # build the frontend only
```

Packaging must run from the **project root** (so the Tauri CLI finds `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`); it builds the frontend
automatically via `beforeBuildCommand`:

```powershell
.\frontend\node_modules\.bin\tauri.cmd build
```

Output: `src-tauri\target\release\sshdeck.exe` and an NSIS installer under `src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\`.

## 4. Data Model

```text
Host  (level 1 = SSH server)
├─ id, name, sshHost, sshPort (default 22), sshUser
├─ identityFile     // private key path; empty uses default id_ed25519
├─ extraOptions     // extra args applied to every ssh operation for this host
├─ proxyJump        // jump host (ProxyJump), optional; adds -J on connect
├─ pinned           // pinned hosts sort first
├─ updatedAt        // Unix ms; list sorts by this, newest first
└─ forwards: Vec<Forward>

Forward (level 2 = a single port forward)
├─ id, name, mode: local | remote | dynamic
├─ bindHost (default 127.0.0.1), bindPort
├─ targetHost (default 127.0.0.1), targetPort   // not needed for dynamic
└─ keepConnected    // default true; auto-reconnect after disconnect
```

- Persistence files (all in the system app-data directory): `hosts.json` (forwards nested inside), `settings.json`,
  and `history.json` (the open-history log).
- `AppSettings` also carries `closeBehavior` (`ask｜minimize｜exit`) — what the window close button does —
  `autoUpdate` (bool) — whether an update found on startup installs automatically — and `updateChannel`
  (`stable｜preview`) — which release channel the updater checks.
- `HistoryEntry` (one open-history row): `id, hostId, kind (vscode｜terminal｜port), label, uri, detail, openedAt`.
  Ports/terminals/VS Code opens are upserted (deduped per host, bumped to now), sorted most-recent-first.
- The v0.1.x `profiles.json` **is not migrated**; if present, it's backed up to `profiles.json.v0.1.bak` on startup.
- Runtime state: `hosts: Mutex<Vec<Host>>`, `tunnels: Mutex<HashMap<ForwardId, ManagedTunnel>>` (one child process per running
  forward, with a snapshot of the parent host for auto-reconnect), plus `settings`, `logs`, and `history`.

## 5. Module Layout

### Backend `src-tauri/src/`

```text
main.rs            entry point + askpass helper
lib.rs             run(), Tauri Builder, single-instance / updater / process plugins, tray icon/menu, window-close handler, command registration, AppState wiring
model.rs           Host / Forward / enums / AppSettings / LogEntry / HistoryEntry / View / Default
store.rs           read_json / write_json, data directory path, AppState persistence and log writes
validate.rs        validate_host / validate_forward / hostname_chars_ok (ASCII-only SSH host check)
portcheck.rs       local port-in-use detection + owning process name/PID (netstat + tasklist)
sshconfig.rs       parse/write ~/.ssh/config (import/export, find a VS Code alias by full connection profile)
vscode.rs          VS Code Remote-SSH: read history, match hosts, maintain exact-profile aliases, shape remote opens
vscode_launcher.rs Locate/launch VS Code and build its documented `--remote` CLI invocation
history.rs         open-history pure logic: upsert/dedup, merge scanned VS Code entries, sort by recency
terminal.rs        open_terminal: launches an external PowerShell window running ssh (optionally `cd`'d into a remote path)
ssh/
  command.rs       build_ssh / build_probe / build_key_upload / build_send command construction
  exec.rs          blocking one-off SSH execution + stdout/stderr merge (called via spawn_blocking)
  diagnose.rs      classify_ssh_failure: classify unreachable/auth/etc. failures from stderr, with localized reasons
  process.rs       start/stop/watch/cleanup tunnel, CREATE_NO_WINDOW, askpass helper
  readiness.rs     wait for a spawned tunnel to listen / reject immediate SSH startup failures
  probe.rs         probe_connection / get_host_fingerprint / remove_known_host
  keys.rs          ensure_public_key / resolve_identity_file / upload_key_to_remote
commands/          thin #[tauri::command] wrappers, one file per domain:
  hosts.rs forwards.rs exec.rs keys.rs settings.rs transfer.rs vscode.rs system.rs history.rs update.rs window.rs
```

`window.rs` also exposes `show_main_window`, used by the tray and the single-instance callback to raise the running window.

### Frontend `frontend/src/`

```text
App.tsx              shell: page routing, data load/refresh, all action/dialog orchestration, theme
types.ts  api.ts  i18n.ts    shared types, IPC calls, UI copy (zh-CN/en-US)
pages/               DashboardPage RemoteConnectionsPage PortForwardingPage LogsPage SettingsPage GuidePage
components/          AppSidebar AppDialogs HostTransferActions HostCard ForwardRow StatusBadge LogTable dialogs.tsx ui/*
```

Dialogs of note in `components/dialogs/remote.tsx`: `RemoteConnectionDialog` (the per-host "Remote Connection" window — a list of
remote paths from VS Code Remote-SSH history, each openable in a terminal `cd`'d into it or in VS Code, plus a
retained manual path field with Terminal / VS Code buttons), and `CloseBehaviorDialog` (the minimize-to-tray vs
quit prompt).

Data loading, polling, and all dialog state are orchestrated centrally in `App.tsx`; pages and components stay purely
presentational (receiving data and callbacks via props). See [MODULARITY.md](MODULARITY.md) for the layering rules behind this split.
The application shell owns viewport height: `AppSidebar` stays fixed while the right-hand page section is the only primary
scroll container.

## 6. Tauri Commands

| Domain | Commands | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host | `list_hosts` `save_host` `set_host_pinned` `delete_host` | `save_host` rejects non-ASCII/space `sshHost`; other usability is checked at connect time; `delete_host` disconnects its forwards first |
| Import/export | `read_import_file` `read_import_ssh_config` `import_hosts` `export_hosts_to_file` `export_hosts_to_ssh_config` | dedup by sshHost/IP; strategy `""` detects conflicts, `overwrite`, or `skip` |
| Forward | `save_forward` `delete_forward` `connect_forward[_with_password]` `disconnect_forward` `disconnect_host` `disconnect_all` | connect probes first; port-in-use is only checked at connect time |
| Command/Terminal | `send_command` `open_terminal` `open_url` | `send_command` runs blocking SSH work through the async runtime's blocking pool, keeping IPC/UI responsive; `open_terminal(hostId, path?)` opens the shell (a non-empty `path` first `cd`s into it); `open_url` opens http/https in the default browser |
| Keys/Probe | `upload_public_key` `probe_connection` `get_host_fingerprint` `remove_known_host` | `probe_connection` returns `ready｜password_required｜host_key_changed`, or an Err with a reason for unreachable hosts |
| Settings/Logs | `get_settings` `save_settings_cmd` `list_logs` | default theme is light |
| System | `check_ssh` `install_openssh` | installs OpenSSH via elevated `Add-WindowsCapability` |
| VS Code | `vscode_status` `vscode_open` `vscode_open_direct` `vscode_open_path` | `vscode_open(uri, hostId, label)` reopens the path with the host's current full SSH profile, bumps the entry, and rescans; history is discovered by IP but connection aliases must also match user/port/key/ProxyJump |
| History | `list_history` | returns a host's open-history (recency-sorted), rescanning + merging VS Code's own history on the way; the Remote Connection dialog shows the `vscode` (remote-path) entries |
| Update | `check_update` `install_update` | channel-aware; each builds the updater with the channel's endpoint (`stable` = releases/latest, `preview` = releases/download/preview/latest.json) and verifies the configured `pubkey` |
| Window | `hide_to_tray` `quit_app` | driven by the close prompt; the tray/single-instance raise the window in Rust |

Events: `log-entry` (one log line); `critical-error` (forward exited with code 255; payload has `hostId/forwardId/name/message`, frontend shows one dialog and stops auto-reconnect); `close-requested` (payload = whether forwards are running; the frontend shows the close/minimize prompt).

## 7. Key Flows

- **Automatic local port fallback** (local/dynamic only): `start_tunnel` calls `find_free_port`, incrementing from the
  configured `bindPort` up to 200 times. `detect_conflict` checks both this app's other running forwards and the OS
  (`netstat` + `tasklist`, ignoring this app's own `ssh.exe` PIDs). The actual port used overrides `bindPort`/`bindDisplay` in
  the view, so Home, the forward row, and "Open in browser" always point at what's really listening. Remote mode listens on
  the remote side, so no local check applies.
- **Connect / auto-reconnect**: `connect_forward` builds `ssh -N -T -L/-R/-D … user@host` and runs it with `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`;
  local/dynamic connections are reported as connected only after the listener accepts TCP (important for slower jump-host handshakes),
  while remote forwards are checked for immediate SSH startup failure;
  `watch_tunnel` polls the child and reconnects after a delay if `keepConnected` is on and the exit wasn't fatal (exit code 255
  → log + `critical-error`, no retry). Editing a running host/forward (`restart_forward`) reuses the cached password and does
  a stop-then-start.
- **One-time password connect**: frontend calls `probe_connection` first — `ready` connects directly, `password_required`
  prompts and calls `connect_forward_with_password` (password injected via `SSH_ASKPASS`, never written to disk, kept in
  memory only if `keepConnected`), `host_key_changed` shows the fingerprint and offers `remove_known_host` + retry.
- **External terminal**: `open_terminal` opens a visible, independent PowerShell window running interactive `ssh`; it's not
  tracked or cleaned up by the app. A non-empty `path` allocates a pty (`-t`) and `cd`s into that remote dir before the
  login shell. A plain (no-path) open is recorded in the history.
- **Remote Connection**: the per-host "Remote Connection" button (and the single Home icon) opens `RemoteConnectionDialog`.
  It lists the host's remote **paths** — `list_history` merges Remote-SSH's `state.vscdb` (preferred, freshest) with
  `storage.json` (fallback), matched to the host by IP. Clicking a record opens a terminal `cd`'d into that path; the
  VS Code button opens it in VS Code (`vscode_open` by URI, else `vscode_open_path`); the pen icon fills the manual field.
  The manual field opens a typed path with either tool — an empty VS Code open falls back to a direct connect
  (`vscode_open_path` → `open_direct_for_host`, which reuses or writes a matching `~/.ssh/config` alias); `~`/relative paths resolve
  against the remote `$HOME` via a one-time passwordless probe. Opening the dialog does not require VS Code; the
  install/Remote-SSH check happens only when a VS Code action is invoked.
- **Open-history**: opening a port, a plain terminal, or a VS Code folder upserts a `HistoryEntry` (deduped per host,
  bumped to now). Opening a port or launching VS Code also rescans VS Code's own history and merges any new folders.
  Terminal-at-path opens are not recorded (they're already represented by the VS Code path list). The recency-sorted
  `vscode` (path) entries feed `RemoteConnectionDialog`.
- **Close to tray / minimize**: `handle_close_requested` (a `WindowEvent::CloseRequested` handler) reads `closeBehavior` —
  `minimize` hides to the tray, `exit` quits when nothing is running, otherwise (or `exit` with forwards live) it prevents the
  close and emits `close-requested` so the UI can prompt. The tray menu offers Show/Quit; clicking the tray icon raises the window.
- **Single instance**: `tauri-plugin-single-instance` (registered first) focuses the running window instead of launching a
  second process.

- **In-app auto-update (channel-aware)**: check and install run in **Rust** (`commands/update.rs`), because the JS
  `check()` can only read the single static endpoint in `tauri.conf.json` — runtime channel selection needs
  `UpdaterExt::updater_builder().endpoints(...)`. `AppSettings.updateChannel` (`stable｜preview`) picks the endpoint:
  stable = `releases/latest/download/latest.json` (GitHub's non-prerelease latest), preview =
  `releases/download/preview/latest.json` (a rolling `preview` pre-release CI refreshes on every beta tag). On startup the
  frontend calls `check_update(channel)`; if a newer signed release exists and `autoUpdate` is on it calls
  `install_update(channel)` (which re-checks, `download_and_install`, then `app.restart()`); otherwise it shows the Home
  banner and the Settings entry, where "Download & install" runs the same command. Settings also offers a manual "Check for
  updates", the channel selector, and the auto-update toggle. The `tauri-plugin-updater` / `tauri-plugin-process` plugins
  stay registered (the Rust updater is built on the former). Releases are signed in CI with the key whose public half is
  pinned in `pubkey` (same key for both channels); the private key + password live in the
  `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY[_PASSWORD]` repo secrets, `bundle.createUpdaterArtifacts` makes the build emit the signed
  archive and `latest.json`, and `.github/workflows/build.yml` publishes pre-release tags directly and mirrors their
  `latest.json` onto the `preview` release.
- **Portable packaging**: `scripts/package-portable.ps1` packages the compiled `sshdeck.exe`, bilingual portable notes,
  license, and `portable.flag` into `SSHDeck_<version>_x64-portable.zip`. The same workflow uploads it beside the NSIS
  installer on tagged releases and includes it in smoke-build artifacts. Portable data remains in the normal system
  app-data directory, so this is install-free rather than a fully self-contained build.

On app exit, all forward child processes started by this app are cleaned up.

## 8. Data Storage

The backend resolves the operating system's per-user local app-data root with `directories::BaseDirs`, then writes
`hosts.json`, `settings.json`, `history.json`, and `logs/` under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SSHDeck\data` on Windows — never into
the source tree or the program's own folder. Config writes are atomic (temp file + rename). The legacy development-era
directory is intentionally not migrated; beta.4 users must export hosts before upgrading and import them afterward.
